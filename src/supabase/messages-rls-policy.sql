-- Row Level Security Policies for Messages Table
-- This file contains all necessary RLS policies to secure the messages table

-- Step 1: Enable RLS on messages table
ALTER TABLE public.messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- ============================================
-- POLICY 1: Users can view their sent messages
-- ============================================
-- Allows users to see messages they sent to others

-- ============================================
-- POLICY 2: Users can view messages sent to them
-- ============================================
-- Allows users to see messages others sent to them

    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    LIMIT 1

-- ============================================
-- POLICY 3: Authenticated users can send messages
-- ============================================
-- Allows any authenticated user to send messages to anyone

    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    LIMIT 1
  )
);

-- ============================================
-- POLICY 4: Receivers can update message read status
-- ============================================
-- Allows receivers to mark their messages as read
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Receivers can update message read status" ON messages;
CREATE POLICY "Receivers can update message read status"
ON public.messages
FOR UPDATE
USING (
  receiver_profile_id = (
    SELECT id FROM public.profiles

  )
)
WITH CHECK (
  receiver_profile_id = (
    SELECT id FROM public.profiles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    LIMIT 1
  )

-- ============================================
-- POLICY 5: Senders can delete their sent messages
-- ============================================
-- Allows senders to delete messages they sent
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Senders can delete their sent messages" ON messages;
CREATE POLICY "Senders can delete their sent messages"

-- ============================================
-- POLICY 6: Receivers can delete received messages
-- ============================================
-- Allows receivers to delete messages sent to them
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Receivers can delete their received messages" ON messages;
CREATE POLICY "Receivers can delete their received messages"

FOR DELETE
USING (

    SELECT id FROM public.profiles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    LIMIT 1
  )
);

-- ============================================
-- VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- ============================================
-- Run these queries to verify RLS policies are working

-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'messages';

-- Check all policies on messages table
SELECT policyname, permissive, roles, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'messages'
ORDER BY policyname;
