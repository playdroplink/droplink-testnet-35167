## Tips & Best Practices

### Audio File Selection

- **Format**: MP3 is most compatible across all browsers
- **Quality**: 128kbps MP3 is good balance of quality vs. file size

### Musical Style
- **Ambient**: Soft, non-intrusive background (best choice)
- **Jazz/Lo-fi**: Relaxing and professional
